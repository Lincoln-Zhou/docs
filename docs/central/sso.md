### Configure SSO on individual networks. 
If you enable this on an existing network, you may accidentally block existing users. Please practice on a test network.

### Exclude specific devices from SSO requirements
This is useful for routers, servers, embedded devices, etcâ€¦
You can do this from the wrench icon in the Members list.


## SSO provider configuration
Visit your SSO provider and use this callback URL:
```
http://localhost:9993/sso
```

Ensure the following scopes are allowed:  `openid`, `profile`, `email`, `offline_access`.

## Provider Specific Configuration Notes

### General SSO Provider Requirements

* Must support [PKCE](https://oauth.net/2/pkce/)
* Requires the following scopes:
  * openid
  * profile
  * email
  * offline_access

### Auth0 
Please ensure the following fields are set on your Auth0 application config:
- Application Type:  Native
- Token Endpoint Authentication Method: None
- Allowed Callback URL: http://localhost:9993/sso
- Under Advanced Settings -> Grant Types, ensure Implicit, Authorization Code, and Refresh Token are selected.

### OneIdentity
OneIdentity may require manual whitelisting of the following scopes: `openid`, `profile`, `email`, `offline_access`.

### Google Workspace
Google OAuth2/OIDC is not supported as Google does not support PKCE clients at this time.

## Customizing the Final SSO Flow Page

If you wish, you can customize the final view of the sso login process. 
Create the file `$ZEROTIER_HOME/sso-auth.template.html`. 

Note: Any CSS or images must be hosted externaly, or placed within the single HTML page itself.

You may customize the page to look however you wish. At this time there
are only two template values set by zerotier:
- `networkId`
- `messageText`

Templates must be valid HTML, and the template values must be placed inside ``{{ ...  }}` blocks like so:

    {{ networkId }}
    {{ messageText }}

You may react to errors via the `isError` variable:

    {% if isError %}
    <span style="color: red;">{{ messageText }}</span>
    {% else %}
    {{ messageText }}
    {% endif %}
